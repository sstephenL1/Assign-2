# Java Project Practice Run

Welcome!

## The goal

The goal of this assignment is to start to become familiar with input, output, data types, and operations in Java.

Complete the code according to the instructions written as comments within each of the `.java` source code files in the `src` dirwctory.

### Folder structure

This project has several important directories:

- `src` - contains the Java source code for the project (i.e. `.java` files)
- `test` - contains code that will help us determine whether the code you have written behaves correctly. Do not touch this directory!
- `bin` - contains the compiled code (i.e. `.class` files)
- `lib` - contains any dependencies (other libraries of code that the project depends upon to work)

If your project has no dependencies and has not been compiled, you may not see the `lib` or `bin` directories.

### How to test your work

Automated tests that can help determine whether you have done the work correctly have been included within the `test` directory. Use them as follows. A [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af6Ka0Bmflo) shows how to do this and overcome any problems:

- Click the Run and Debug icon in the Visual Studio Code activity bar, then click the play button to run your code without using the automated tests. Do this prior to running the tests to make sure your program seems to behave correctly yourself.
- Open the relevant test file, located within the `test` directory.
- Click the Test icon (a beaker) in the Visual Studio Code activity bar and click the play button to run those tests. Tests that pass will be marked with a green checkmark, while those that fail will be marked with a red "X".
- Each test that fails will show a message with some indication of what went wrong - these messages may help you pinpoint the source of the error.

If you have trouble running the tests from within Visual Studio Code, you can do them from within a Terminal window, assuming the project directory is the current working directory (change `TestClassName` to the relevant name fo the test class.)

```bash
java -cp "bin:lib/*" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore edu.nyu.cs.TestClassName
```

Windows users should replace the `:` in `"bin:lib/*"` with a semi-colon, `;`, i.e. `"bin;lib/*"`

## How to submit this assignment

Once you have completed your changes to this project, you are ready to submit it. Do this from within Visual Studio Code.

1. Click on the `Source Control` icon in the left activity bar in Visual Studio Code.
1. In the Source Control side bar, you will see a field named `Message` - type in a unique message about what you have done, e.g. "_Finished assignment!_" or whatever you want to write as a short note to yourself.
1. Hover over the words `Source Control`. You will see a `...` icon appear - click it to see a menu. In that menu, click `Commit`->`Commit`. This logs the changes you've made to the Git project - remember Git is used to keep track of changes.
1. Go to the same menu and click `Push` to submit your assignment - this uploads your updated files to the copy of your respository on GitHub.

That's it... you're done.

## Double-check your submission

Prove to yourself that you have correctly submitted by viewing your repository on the GitHub website - you should see your completed files there.

## Resubmit as many times as you want

You can re-submit as many times as you want before the deadline. Just make changes to the files on your own computer and repeat the process outlined above to upload them to GitHub.
